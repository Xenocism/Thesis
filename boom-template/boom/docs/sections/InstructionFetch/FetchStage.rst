    :alt: The Fetch Unit

    The Fetch Unit. The grey box is the front-end instantiated from the Rocket code base.


BOOM instantiates the Rocket core’s *Front-end* (highlighted in grey
in :numref:`fetch-unit` , which fetches instructions and predicts every
cycle where to fetch the next instructions using a “next-line predictor"
(NLP). If a misprediction is detected in BOOM’s backend, or BOOM’s own
predictor wants to redirect the pipeline in a different direction, a
request is sent to the Front-End and it begins fetching along a new
instruction path. See :ref:`Branch Prediction` for more information on
how branch prediction fits into the Fetch Unit’s pipeline.

Since superscalar fetch is supported, the *Front-end* returns a
*fetch packet* of instructions. The *fetch packet* also contains
meta-data, which includes a *valid mask* (which instructions in the
packet are valid?) and some branch prediction information that is used
later in the pipeline.

The Rocket I-Cache
------------------

BOOM instantiates the i-cache found in the Rocket processor source code.
The i-cache is a virtually indexed, physically tagged set-associative
cache.

To save power, the i-cache reads out a fixed number of bytes (aligned)
and stores the instruction bits into a register. Further instruction
fetches can be managed by this register. The i-cache is only fired up
again once the fetch register has been exhausted (or a branch prediction
directs the PC elsewhere).

The i-cache does not (currently) support fetching across cache-lines,
nor does it support fetching unaligned relative to the superscalar fetch
address. [1]_

The i-cache does not (currently) support hit-under-miss. If an icache
miss occurs, the icache will not accept any further requests until the
miss has been handled. This is less than ideal for scenarios in which
the pipeline discovers a branch mispredict and would like to redirect
the icache to start fetching along the correct path.

The front-end (currently) only handles the RV64G ISA, which uses
fixed-size 4 bytes instructions.

The Fetch Buffer
----------------

*Fetch packets* coming from the i-cache are placed into a *Fetch
Buffer*. The *Fetch Buffer* helps to decouple the instruction
fetch front-end from the execution pipeline in the back-end.

The instructions within a *fetch packet* are *not* collapsed or
compressed - any bubbles within a *fetch packet* are maintained.

The *Fetch Buffer* is parameterizable. The number of entries can be
changed and whether the buffer is implemented as a “flow-through"
queue [2]_ or not can be toggled.

.. [1] This constraint is due to the fact that a cache-line is not stored
    in a single row of the memory bank, but rather is striped across a
    single bank to match the refill size coming from the uncore.
    Fetching unaligned would require modification of the underlying
    implementation, such as banking the i-cache such that consecutive
    chunks of a cache-line could be accessed simultaneously.

.. [2] A flow-through queue allows entries being enqueued to be
    immediately dequeued if the queue is empty and the consumer is
    requesting (the packet “flows through" instantly).
